## 📖 Description
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Inheritance** in C# with an Employee hierarchy:  

- `Employee` (base class) defines common properties like `Id`, `Name`, and `Salary`.  
- `Manager` (derived class) adds `TeamSize` and a `ManageProject()` method.  
- `Developer` (derived class) adds `Language` and a `WriteCode()` method.  
- Each derived class **overrides** `Describe()` to provide specialized information.
